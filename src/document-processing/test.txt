Objective
Build a simplified web-based system integrating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with a Knowledge Base. The system should allow users to:
* Upload documents to create a Knowledge Base.
* Query the Knowledge Base and receive AI-generated responses enriched with retrieved context.
Assignment Scope
You are required to develop a full-stack web application with:
 :white_tick: 
 Knowledge Base Management
* Upload structured/unstructured documents (PDF, TXT, CSV, JSON).
* Store and index documents using a vector database (FAISS, ChromaDB, or Weaviate).
 :white_tick: 
 Query & Response Generation
* Retrieve relevant content from the Knowledge Base.
* Generate AI responses using an LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face).
* Show the retrieved context alongside the AI-generated response.

 Tech Stack:
* Backend: Nest.js (TypeScript) with a minimal Express.js layer.
* Frontend: Vue.js + TailwindCSS.
* Vector DB: FAISS, ChromaDB, or Weaviate or anything open source.
* LLM: OpenAI, Hugging Face, or LlamaIndex.
